title: "Get started (code)"
---

This article is identical to "Get started" but the text is commented out so you
can copy-paste and run it as a single .R script.

```{r include=FALSE}
output <- tempfile()
input <- here::here("vignettes", "articles", "tilt-company-match.Rmd")
knitr::purl(input, output, documentation = 2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=""}
writeLines(readLines(output))
```
